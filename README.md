# NC News React App

[Link to demo version](https://newsandcomment.netlify.app/)

Welcome to the NC News React app! This application was created as part of my bootcamp experience at [northcoders](https://northcoders.com) as one of a number of projects completed on the course. The purpose of creating the app was to consolidate everything that I had learned about frontend development.

In simple terms, the app is a front app which allows users read and write news articles. It allows the sorting of articles in a number of ways and also allows commenting. Finally, the app allows users to vote on their favourite articles and comments. 

The app was developed using React and interacts with the backend via axios. Styling has been done with regular CSS - there are css files for each component and an app.cs which contains general styling for use across the app.
